# Notice
This is not an official fork of TPPets. Anyone who finds this repository is welcome to use our changes, but we do not provide a pre-compiled jar. We've not made any design changes to the plugin, nor do we plan to. This fork is simply for maintaining a functioning version of the plugin for our server. If you have questions or comments, open an issue or post to our [forums](https://www.peacefulcraft.net/) and we'll get back to you.
